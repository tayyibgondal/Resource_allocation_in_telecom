    taking into account the specific channel conditions. The function aims to maximize either 
    Spectral Efficiency (SE) or Energy Efficiency (EE) while ensuring constraints are met.

    Parameters:
    - channel: A 3D array representing the channel gains for each user and sample.
    - tx_max: Maximum transmission power allowed for each user.
    - noise: Noise level affecting the transmission.
    - DUE_thr: Minimum capacity threshold for D2D users.
    - I_thr: Interference threshold for CUE (Cellular User Equipment).
    - P_c: Constant power consumed regardless of transmission.
    - tx_power_set: Set of transmission power configurations to consider.
    - opt: Objective for optimization, either "SE" for Spectral Efficiency or "EE" for Energy Efficiency.

    Returns:
    - tot_SE: Total Spectral Efficiency.
    - tot_EE: Total Energy Efficiency.
    - PRO_CUE_vio: Probability of CUE violations.
    - PRO_DUE_vio: Probability of D2D violations.
    - chan_infea_mat: Channels that were found infeasible.
    - power_mat_SE: Array of optimal power settings for each sample.
    - channel: The input channel array for reference.
